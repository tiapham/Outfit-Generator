# Outfit-Generator
This Outfit Generator app allows the user to create outfits and have outfits generated from images of clothing items in the user's closet.

This is my first personal project ever! After watching the movie, Clueless, which featured a wardrobe computer app that assisted the main character, Cher, in the everyday task of getting dressed, I really wanted to make my own beginner friendly version. Using the Java I learned from intro programming classes this year and my new exposure to Android Studio, I created this simple functioning application that I would use to help make life a little easier. 

Don't know what to wear? Just click the "dress me!" button and a cute outfit is prepared. Browse through your closet and see if you can create new visually appealing combinations of clothes you wouldn't have thought of.

Currently, it can only be used from within Android Studio because images have to be added directly to the internal storage, but if I continue to develop this app, I will implement features that allow a mobile user to upload and store images on their phone. Also, I would add more clothing item options, as right now it is limited to shirts, bottoms, and shoes.
